# The Library of Monitoring Objects - LMO

## Scope
A list of of metrics and summary statistics, specific to different industries and businesses 
like _computer performance data_, _meteorology_, _healthcare_, _environmental monitoring_.
The main idea here is to define and describe a set of metrics which can be easily used in software products like, 
real-time web analytic, data analytic software, data reporting software as a open standard format, JSON or XML based.

## Why ?
Because in general people collect thousands of metrics without any idea what to do with them or if they really need them. Even more because people spend a tremendous amount of time developing within their organizations such metrics which become obsolete and not maintained after some time. And because their is no minimal standardization efforts, regarding computer performance data, for example. 

## To Whom ?
Individuals, experts and companies involved in data analysis, analytics, monitoring are called to discuss, review and contribute to these metric definitions.


## Summary Statistics


## Format
We plan offering the library as JSON files, by default. Additional formats will be available: XML, YAML.


## Industries
The LMO can map and describe data from different industries, currently handling ICT, 
Meteorology and Environmental Monitoring.
