# The Library of Monitoring Objects - LMO

## Scope
A list of of metrics and summary statistics, specific to different industries and businesses 
like _IIoT_, _computer performance data_, _meteorology_, _healthcare_, _environmental monitoring_.
The main idea here is to define and describe a set of metrics which can be easily used in software products like, 
real-time web analytic, data analytic software, data reporting software as a open standard format, JSON or 
XML based.

## Why ?
Because in general people collect thousands of metrics without any idea what to do with them or if they _really_ 
need them. Even more because people spend a tremendous amount of time developing software to fetch, 
collect and maintain such metrics which become obsolete and not maintained after some time. 

## To Whom ?
Software engineers, devops, scientists, analysts, meteorologists, companies involved in data analysis, analytics and 
performance monitoring.


## Summary Statistics
A series of summary statistic functions, like MAX, MIN, SUM, COUNT, MEAN, PERCENTILE. These functions are direct 
involved in turning data into useful information. These summary statistics have been developed by experts from each 
industry, by carefully looking and analysing what information is required by the end-user or applications.

## Format
Currently the library is structured as a series of JSON, XML, YAML files.

## Industries
The LMO can map and describe data from different industries, currently handling ICT, Meteorology and 
Environmental Monitoring. We are starting to work and define different object types for IoT and IIoT.
