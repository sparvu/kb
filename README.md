# Knowledge Base

## Overview
A set of intelligent objects, or data neurons, mapping real-world devices or systems, like weather stations, air quality sensors, computer and network systems, operating systems, entreprise services, including all necessarily metrics and summary statistics required for analysing their performance, availability and reliability. The objects are grouped by specific industries, like ICT, environmental monitoring, meteorology, business intelligence, industrial IoT. A data neuron is the fundamental entity responsible to keep vital information in relation to a real-world object, including: a body which contains the source of data and its connectivity . It has a 

In general, people collect a lot of data, thousands of parameters without a very good understanding what to do with all this data, how to use it on the longer run, what to analyse and visualise and how to store it. The data neurons are essential and central for any data analytics process, from data recording to analysis and visualisation, offering a complete set of objects ready to be used within any data analytics product. The library is designed for software engineers, devops, scientists, analysts, meteorologists and companies involved in data analysis, performance analysis, and analytics.

## Industries
Kronometrix Intelligent Objects, are made of data neurons. The data neurons map and describe data from different industries, currently handling ICT, 
meteorology and environmental monitoring. We are working heavily to add different objects
from industrial IOT.
