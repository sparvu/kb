# Knowledge Base

Kronometrix Knowledge-Base is a a semantic representation of real-world objects from different industries, used by Kronometrix Distributed Data Fabric.

## Overview
Includes a set of objects, or data neurons, mapping real-world devices or systems, like weather stations, air quality sensors, computer, network or storage systems, operating systems or enterprise services. These objects include all necessarily metrics and summary statistics required for certain activities, like performance analysis, availability or reliability reporting. These entities, the data neurons can connect to other data neurons, building and providing fast informational data links, used to help the data analysis process or visualization. The data neurons are grouped by specific industries, like ICT, weather and environment, preventive healthcare or industrial IoT.

## Scope
It is very hard to map real-world objects and provide a simple capability to analyse their functionality and performance. Such objects, can have hundreds or even thousands of parameters, collecting all these parameters might not help us to build a very efficient data analysis process. Sometimes, we do not know what to do with all this data, how to use it, what to analyse and visualise and how to store it. To simplify all of these, we have created a knowledge-base system, which contains real-world objects, including their main parameters. This is very experimental work.
