# The Library of Monitoring Objects - LMO

## Overview
A library set of objects, mapping real-world entities, like weather stations, environmental sensors, computer and network systems, operating systems, entreprise services including the metrics and summary statistics required for analysing their performance, availability and reliability. The objects are grouped by specific industries, like ICT, Environmental Monitoring, Meterology, Business Intelligence, IIoT. 

In general, people collect thousands of metrics without any idea what to do with them or if they _really_ need them. Even more  people spend a tremendous amount of time developing solutions to collect and analyse such metrics which soon become deprecated and not useful anymore. The library of monitoring objects is essential and central for any data analytics process from data recording to analysis and visualisation.  

The library is designed for software engineers, devops, scientists, analysts, meteorologists and companies involved in data analysis, performance monitoring and analytics.

## Industries
The LMO can map and describe data from different industries, currently handling ICT, Meteorology and Environmental Monitoring. We are working heavily to add different objects from industrial IOT.
