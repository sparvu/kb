# The Library of Monitoring Objects 

## Overview
A set of objects, mapping real-world devices or systems, like weather stations, 
air quality sensors, computer and network systems, operating systems, entreprise services, 
including all necessarily metrics and summary statistics required for analysing their 
performance, availability and reliability. The objects are grouped by specific industries,
like ICT, environmental monitoring, meteorology, business intelligence, industrial IoT. 

In general, people collect a lot of data, thousands of parameters without a very good 
understanding what to do with all this data, how to use it on the longer run, what to
analyse and visualise and how to store it. The library of monitoring objects is essential 
and central for any data analytics process, from data recording to analysis and 
visualisation, offering a complete set of objects ready to be used within any data analytics
product. The library is designed for software engineers, devops, scientists, analysts, 
meteorologists and companies involved in data analysis, performance analysis, and analytics.

## Industries
The library maps and describes data from different industries, currently handling ICT, 
meteorology and environmental monitoring. We are working heavily to add different objects
from industrial IOT.
