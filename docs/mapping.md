## Data Mapping

This section describes how can you create a new data source object, along with all needed 
information: the data messages, the summary statistics, the alarms and devices.

Kronometrix interconnects with the real world using the library of monitoring objects, a
collection of data source objects, messages as described [here](README.md). 

Before doing that, you need to create a new data source object, by
defining what data messages, summary statistics you are interested in and ultimately
what information you will visualize and report. 



### Format
Currently the library is structured as a series of JSON, XML, YAML files.
