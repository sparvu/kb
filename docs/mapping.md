## Data Mapping

This section describes how can you create a new data source object, along with all needed 
information: its data messages, summary statistics, alarms and devices.

Suppose you have a new sensor, or device you would liket to add to Kronometrix to record
and analyse data from. Before doing that, you need to create a new data source object, by
defining what data messages, summary statistics you are interested in and ultimately
what information you will visualize and report. 



### Format
Currently the library is structured as a series of JSON, XML, YAML files.
