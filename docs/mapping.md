## Data Mapping

This section describes how can you create a new data source object, along with all needed 
information: the data messages, the summary statistics, the alarms and devices. For this 
example we will use a simple indoor air quality device, from Tongdy corporation, called
G01-IAQ, documented [here][1]

### Pre-requisites

Before writing the new DS object, make sure you know the following details about it:

 * hardware model, type
 
 * the protocol used
 
 * the parameters

#### Hardware characteristics

Start by simple writing down the hardware details about this device:

 * Manufacturer: Tongdy
 * Device 


#### The messages

#### Summary statistics

#### The object
