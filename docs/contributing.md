### Add your own intelligent object(s)
You can add your own objects to the object knowledge-base. We are more than happy to receive your object defintions, to validate for acceptance. We have a very simple procedure to check your object defintion, including data messages, summary statistics before accepting them as objects.

### Feedback
If you have any suggestions, ideas, questions, please contact us by opening a [new change request](https://github.com/sparvu/kb/issues).
